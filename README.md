## About

This project will be about Louisville Kentucky hate crimes. Specifically against African Americans, and  how the hate crime rates  raised after the murder of Breonna Taylor. Breonna Taylor was a 26 year old African American  killed by the Louisville police department on March 13th 2020. There were "Black Lives Matter" protests that took place after the news spread about this incident. It was a very emotional, and scary time in this city.

## Conclusion 

After analyzing this data I learned that African Americans in Louisville are more likely to be a victim of a hate crime than any other demographic. I thought that the awareness of how African Americans are treated especially by law enforcement that hate crime rates would  decrease. That obviously was not the case. In fact, the rates tripled in 2020.
